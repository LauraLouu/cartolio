## 11. Mar 2020 - Map Gallery implemented
Practicing Vue.js on the way I started collecting and implementing the maps. To display them interstingly not only in a list, they are also filterable. More maps are getting added by time. Only maps, that I can find an author and source for are available. Have fun exploring!

## 8. Jan 2020 - Cartosquad going live! (on Netlify)
I finally figured out how to deploy the site to be able to use the content and contribute from other places than my laptop. There are many construction sites left, but I found myself in situations where I could have used the information I collected here but was unable to access as I only had it locally stored on my laptop. Not anymore! And now everyone is able to gather content. Have fun exploring!
