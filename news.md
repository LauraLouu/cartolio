## 8 Jun 2020 - Color Schemes visualized
[Here](Guide/colorramps) is a starting collection of color schemes with visual examples depending on use case (for now base map and choropleth maps). The colors are given in HEX and RGB. The collection will be updated continously.

## 6 Jun 2020 - Picking up Work again
After some exciting months with a lot of change regarding plans, job, etc. due to COVID-19, I am now able to continue working on Cartosquad. Theory studies are being worked on, tutorials will be included, techniques outlined and content updated, such as the conference overview (is deleted for now). 

## 11 Mar 2020 - Map Gallery implemented
Practicing Vue.js on the way I started collecting and implementing the maps. To display them interstingly not only in a list, they are also filterable. More maps are getting added by time. Only maps, that I can find an author and source for are available. Have fun exploring!

## 8 Jan 2020 - Cartosquad going live! (on Netlify)
I finally figured out how to deploy the site to be able to use the content and contribute from other places than my laptop. There are many construction sites left, but I found myself in situations where I could have used the information I collected here but was unable to access as I only had it locally stored on my laptop. Not anymore! And now everyone is able to gather content. Have fun exploring!
