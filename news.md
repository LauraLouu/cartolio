## 8. Jan 2020 - Cartosquad going live! (on Netlify)
I finally figured out how to deploy the site to be able to use the content and contribute from other places than my laptop. There are many construction sites left, but I found myself in situations where I could have used the information I collected here but was unable to access as I only had it locally stored on my laptop. Not anymore! And now everyone is able to gather content. Have fun exploring!
