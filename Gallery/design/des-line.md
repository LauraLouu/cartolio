description: Satellite images always manage to amaze me. Google Earth View was a collection of amazing patterns offered by the world's landscapes. Distinctive shapes are recoginzable and this fun app lets you draw a line and shows you a matching satellite image with such a pattern made by roads, beaches, fields, mountains and what else you can think of.
