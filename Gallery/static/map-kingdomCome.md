title: Kingdom Come Deliverance
description: Videogame maps have come a long way and to create a style that represents the game's theme is a challenge. Traveling through Bohemia as Henry in 1403 this map does not break any immersion whatsoever, as the artwork for these outstanding papertown maps matches the athmosphere and game perfectly. I spent way to long looking at these maps while playing this game. Beautifully done!
