title: Beyond the Sea
description: Have you ever been to the beach, looked at the horizon and wondered what lays on the other side of the ocean? This map visualizes what is located across the sea when looking straight out. While it is interesting to discover places you would not have guessed, the maps also illustrate the distortion and geographical interaction of map projections.
