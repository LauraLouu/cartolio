title: Netflix The Witcher Interactive Map
description: Finished the first season and left confused? I get it. I read the books and knew what was when but the time/location aspect if this series is seriously irritating. That's why they made this beautiful map with amazing animation to enlighten the fans and anyone interested. It's also a great way to catch up before season 2, but who does not retwatch the first season?
