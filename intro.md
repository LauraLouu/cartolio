# Introduction

Welcome to my personal notebook with everything about cartography and maps!

While being active as a cartographer and studying cartography many interesting resources, blogs, tools and guides have been found which this collection consists of. While keeping it clear, it is hard to not loose overview so that I created this documentation. It is mostly filled with external links to further sites to find information and assets but also serves as a documentation or note pad for techniques and principles regarding map visualizations and development. 

The content is collaborated through scientific research (having a Master's degree in Cartography certainly set the stone), shared content by communities and own research. Every extern source is linked back to give credit to the content creator.

I DO NOT guarantee the correctness of the content, as it is my personal research and interpretation of the information. Feel free to contact me for tips, feedback & critique, or missing information at [GitHub/LauraLouu](https://github.com/LauraLouu). :v:

Here are information collected that is basic knowledge but important to not forget when making maps. Color combinations, font pairings, the selection of projections and data visualisations are introduced and illustrated. Last a collaboration of other resources offering tips and guides is given.

<!--### Open Data Map
So this map is still **in progress** as it turns out to be a huge task to fulfill. What I aim to achieve is an overview of geospatial open data providers corresponding to their location or geographical extent of their data. -->

### Map Gallery

The map gallery is a collection of **my** favourite maps highlighting what I like about it and of course linking the author. So as this is highly subjective I love to discover all sorts of maps.

The world is full of information and people passionate about geospatial data and map making. While compiling different notes of blogs, books, etc. I stumbled into a rabbit hole. So many projects, so much information.
