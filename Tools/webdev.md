## Base map style providers and custom styles

[Leaflet Provider](https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/)  
Leaflet Provider is an extension for LeafletJS offering different (mostly raster tile) base maps contributed by different providers such as OpenStreetMap, Thunderforest, Esri, Stamen, etc. To use many of the listed base maps an **API-Key** for the provider services is often necessary.

[Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/)  
Mapbox Studio is part of the product portfolio and lets developers design their very own custom map style using Mapbox' vector tiles and specification. The styles can then be incorporated into applications and web maps. A fun tool connected to Studio is [Mapbox Cartogram](https://apps.mapbox.com/cartogram/#13.01/40.7251/-74.0051) where you can upload an image and a map style is generated from the RGB values. 

[Maputnik](https://maputnik.github.io/editor/#0.85/0/0)  
Maputnik is an **open-source and free** editor for vector data using _Mapbox Style Specification_. It is possible to include vector tiles from different sources (Mapbox, Thunderforest, OpenMapTiles) into one base map. The generated style JSON can then be used for custom base maps. 

[Carto basemap styles](https://github.com/CartoDB/basemap-styles)  
The three default base map style specifications of Carto (_Voyager, Positron and Dark Matter_) are open for access on the github page of CartoDB and can be used for vector tile base maps. 

[Mapzen Tangram](https://www.mapzen.com/products/tangram/)  
With Mapzen's **open-sourced** Tangram users have control of their own map style using vector data available for web maps (_Tangram JS_) and mobile apps (_Tangram ES_). 

## Content Management Systems 
![#355834](https://placehold.it/12/355834/000000?text=+) [Masterportal](https://www.masterportal.org/)  
Masterportal is an __open source__ Geoportal with many features that make it a great tool for displaying and providing geospatial data. 

![#355834](https://placehold.it/12/355834/000000?text=+) [BlueSpice Wiki](https://bluespice.com/)  
A responsive and dynamic Wiki based on MediaWiki to manage documentations of any kind.
