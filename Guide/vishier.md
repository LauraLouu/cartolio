<!-- Wikipedia: An important factor in map symbols is the order in which they are ranked according to their relative importance. This is known as intellectual hierarchy. The most important hierarchy is the thematic symbols and type labels that are directly related to the theme. Next comes the title, subtitle, and legend.[1] The map must also contain base information, such as boundaries, roads, and place names. Data source and notes should be on all maps. Lastly, the scale, neat lines, and north arrow are the least important of the hierarchy of the map. From this we see that the symbols are the single most important thing to build a good visual hierarchy that shows proper graphical representation. When producing a map with good visual hierarchy, thematic symbols should be graphically emphasized. A map with a visual hierarchy that is effective attracts the map user's eyes to the symbols with the most important aspects of the map first and to the symbols with the lesser importance later. -->


## Figure-Ground Effect 

Peterson (2015) also speaks about the figure-ground rule, where certain objects need to be separated from its surroundings although the task of the background is to guarantee geographic context, which is as important as emphasizing the foreground. The author as well as Traun (2016) mention examples such as contrasting colors, or border highlighting and later on speaks more detailed about contrast explaining that high saturated colored objects shift the viewerâ€™s focus to the important object in the foreground separating it from the opposing saturated background.
