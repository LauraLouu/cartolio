# Point Visualization 

>“Whether a feature is a point or an area depends on the map scale.” (Brewer 2016, p. 180). 

In regards of point phenomena starting from a small scale, point features, such as capital cities, become areas as soon as a certain large scale is reached. Geographical phenomena that are commonly represented by point symbols are:

-	Population centers: cities, towns, villages, settlements
-	Points of interests 
-	Mountain peaks 
-	Label placements (of line or area features, such as street or country names)

Point data on the other hand can consist of 


## Visual Variables used for Point Symbols

See also [Visual Variables](/Guide/visvar.html).

Shape and color are the primarily used variable for point features to distinguish qualitative characteristics. The color filling gives contrast to the surrounding map elements and reinforces legibility. A shape can either be a simple ge-ometric form or more complex in form of icons (also referred as pictograms or glyphs). 

Pictograms resemblance features by using shapes that are associated with the object represented, e.g. a plane for airports. They should be easy to identify and distinguishable effortlessly. Consider that not all readers intuitively understand the meaning behind an iconic symbol, even though it may be used commonly on many maps, e.g. tent symbol for campgrounds. Additionally, symbols are evolv-ing: when designing symbols, outdated icons are to avoid, but simultaneously certain cartographic conventions should be maintained. In any case, a legend should provide further information, especially when many symbols are given. 

Size is used to build hierarchies or symbolize data values, usually in total numbers. This is especially reasonable when many point symbols of a category are placed on the map; a concept called symbol levels. Combining multiple visual variables can emphasize different meanings, but when symbolizing nominal data, it should be avoided as it can result in creating an order by changing sizes. 

If point symbols are overlapping and it must stay conserved, it is advisable to add an outline (halo) to the symbol to prevent confusion. 

Often changes regarding the orientation of point symbols are hard to see due to the small size of point features, but there are cases, when orientation can be effectively applied on point symbols: wind or current direction on a meteorological map, temporal data (time of a day) or political orientation (left or right leaning) are some examples.
