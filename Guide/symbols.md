# Map Symbolizations
A map is a complex communication tool and transmit their meaning through symbols. The symbolization of data and features on a map is depending on various factors. The design of a basemap is featured in another [section](/Guide/basemap.html). In this section a collection of symbilzation techniques and considerations are listed to keep in mind when visualizing data. 

There is the symbolization for map features that exist in real life called **phenomena** (e.g. building outline) or make up the base map (e.g. boundary) and there is the design of statistical or geographical **data** used on thematic maps. Depending on the use case, data structure and map layout, the symbolization is key to bring across the message and purpose of the map. 

There is no universal or standardized symbol system established as of now but some principles have caught on internationally. The challenge faced by the cartographer is the multilevel perception to use symbols that a map reader can identify from a legend and determine its spatial relationship. 

Based on [Visual Variables](/Guide/visvar.html), certain cartographic principles exist to ensure best readability and understanding.

A point symbol refers to a specific phenomena and its location. It usually represents the center of its representing object.
