# Guide & Wiki
Here are information collected that is basic knowledge but important to not forget when making maps. Color combinations, font pairings, the selection of projections and data visualisations are introduced and illustrated. Last a collaboration of other resources offering tips and guides is given. 

## Color in Maps 

Selecting colors is one of the most important step when designing a map. There are reasons why color should not be seen as an afterthought in map design but rather as one of the intermediate stages. They impact a user psychologically and emotionally based on associations with experiences made in life, personal preferences and cultural influences. The map designer needs to know the meaning of the color, to prompt the desired reaction to a map.

## Font Usage in Maps
Apart from color an important map design component is text: **labels, title** and **legend entries**. As with every layout decision create a certain mood and impression on the overall map, so it needs to be kept in mind what font is suited the best for the purpose.

## Visual Variables 
Cartographers should pay special attention to match a design between the different symbols as the smallest details can change how the geographical data is interpreted. The individual feature groups demand a different combination of Bertin’s visual variables.

## Data Classification
When visualizing data for thematic maps, e.g. choropleth maps, the biggest task (at least for me) seems to be on how to organize the data used on the map to show a useful representation depicting the truth. This is to reveal patterns in the data set and create a sensible map. Similar values are grouped together and visualized accordingly to emphasize certain statements the map maker aims to visualize.

## Map Symbolizations <Badge text="in progress" type="warning"/>
A map is a complex communication tool and transmit their meaning through symbols. The symbolization of data and features on a map is depending on various factors. There is the symbolization for map features that exist in real life called **phenomena** (e.g. building outline) or make up the base map (e.g. boundary) and there is the design of statistical or geographical **data** used on thematic maps. Depending on the use case, data structure and map layout, the symbolization is key to bring across the message and purpose of the map.

## Types of Maps  <Badge text="in progress" type="warning"/>
With all kinds of data and information there is a purpose and etablished method on how to effectfully visualize it. Different kinds of maps and its symbolizations are used bring across a message to the map reader. This collection lists these types with a simple and suitable example.

## Projections & Coordinate Systems
The problem with maps is that no map is undistorted. Because a round (three dimensional) body , such as the Earth, is brought to a flat (two dimensional) surface distortions regarding shape, direction or distances are inevitable. Therefore, there is no perfect map projection. Different projections were established to serve certain purposes so some may be used for specific tasks and extends.
