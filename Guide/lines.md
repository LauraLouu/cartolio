# Line Visualization

> “Linear phenomena are features that are line-like in reality and may be thought of as having only one significant dimension: length.” (Tyner 2010, p. 134). 

Some features can be seen in reality (rivers) others are not concrete objects on the earth’s surface (boundaries). They can also indicate abstract directions such as flow lines of migration direction. In various cases line features can become areas as well depending on the map scale. This applies for example to rivers that appear as line features in small scales but are symbolized as areas in large scales. Features that are symbolized by lines are for example: 

-	Transportation 
-	Waterways 
-	Boundaries  
-	Utilities  
-	Elevation and temperature isolines  

## Visual Variables used for Line Symbols

See also [Visual Variables](/Guide/visvar.html).

In terms of shape, a line symbol varies by changing the form, e.g. solid, dashed, crossed out. This technique creates a pattern by differentiating spacing and length of the dash. With the use of arrangement, the pattern can get more complex. 

The size refers to the line width which indicates importance or actual an actual amount of flow data. Orientation may be used to show the direction, such as a road direction. With these variables nominal data and quantitative data can be represented in line features (see fig. ??). 

An important cartographic technique used in line symbolization is the casing, which is the equivalent to a halo around a text or point shape. It is formed by giving the line an outline and increases visibility, especially when the line runs over many different backgrounds. 

## Isopleth Maps 
In isoplet maps isolines are used connecting points of the same value.
